Outline Plan for Integrating Game State-Dependent Poker Statistics

Contextual Setup

Game State Tracking: Ensure your game logic can accurately determine the current state of the game, especially distinguishing between pre-flop, post-flop, and showdown phases.
Postflop Actions (Call, Bet, Raise)

Tracking Postflop Actions:
Objective: Update player statistics based on actions taken after the flop.
Implementation:
In your game loop, identify when the game moves into the postflop phase (after the flop cards are dealt).
Monitor player actions during this phase. When a player bets, raises, or calls, update their statistics accordingly.

Example Code:

if is_postflop():
    if player_action == 'bet':
        player.stats.update_postflop_action('bet')
    elif player_action == 'raise':
        player.stats.update_postflop_action('raise')
    elif player_action == 'call':
        player.stats.update_postflop_action('call')



Showdown Frequency

Tracking Showdown Frequency:
Objective: Record how often a player reaches the showdown.
Implementation:
At the end of each hand, check if the player is still in the game and has reached the showdown.
Update the player's showdown statistics if they have reached this stage.

Example Code:

if player_reaches_showdown(player):
    player.stats.update_showdown()



Preflop Raise Frequency

Tracking Preflop Raises:
Objective: Keep track of how often a player raises during the pre-flop round.
Implementation:
In the pre-flop betting round, monitor player actions.
If a player raises, update their preflop raise statistics.

Example Code:

if is_preflop() and action_is_raise(player_action):
    player.stats.update_preflop_raise()
